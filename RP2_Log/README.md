# CAPTCHA Log

A Firefox extension to a build an archive of contextual data→information about CAPTCHAs encountered during everyday browsing. The extension focuses on hCaptcha, Arkose MatchKey, and Arkose funCaptcha for their (as personally observed) multi-step, increasingly cognitively burdensome user experience. The extension conducts lightweight logging for other (major) CAPTCHA schemes.
