# Your Biggest Fan

A Firefox extension for user to track their cursor movement and annotate segments comprising CAPTCHA work.

### Background
The name for this extension comes from a stray idea from the fall for a theory class assignment to make something that responds to the collection and accumulation of everyday (perhaps domestic) data. Reflecting on various universities’ use of student ID swipes to surveil student activity, I sketched out a robotic arm-based drawing of my location across campus.

“Your Biggest Fan” has returned as a cursor tracker that’s a side quest as I develop a CAPTCHA Log to help me better reflect on my daily encounters with CAPTCHAs. The extension is Firefox based for now to respect my personal browsing habits.


### Bibliography
Shan Huang, _[Iconic History](https://github.com/yemount/IconicHistory)_ (2014); Kyle McDonald, _[Important Things](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kylemcdonald/5430950331/in/album-72157625874470177)_ (2011); Robert M Ochshorn & Eyal Sivan, _[Montage Interdit](https://rmozone.com/montageinterdit/)_ (2012). 

I’ve long been a fan of Ochshorn’s work on compression and video transcription interfaces. I learned of slit scans through the video archive he and Sivan built — being able to sift through the media from different entry points, whether the video itself, its transcription, speakers, or tags — has been an incredibly resonant interaction paradigm. [Daragh](https://daraghbyrne.me/) shared Huang’s _Iconic History_ and [Golan](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-412) directed me to McDonald’s _Important Things_ — both works that visualize personal interfacing with the web in a tapestry-like grid format.
