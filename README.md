# Thesis repo
Alright... committing to GitHub because I just _know_ I’d fuss over the styling of all this if I keep it as a separate TiddlyWiki. I think this will be a central repository for all my evolving learnings about this specific field (human computation) and I’ll use this as a way to keep myself accountable so that I’m on track.
