## Abstract
A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is an instance of a challenge-response test, or human interactive proof, used to distinguish discernibly “human” users of a computer system or digital service from their automated, bot counterparts. This mundane feature of contemporary web security was formalized in academia as a “human computation system” in 2011 following prior theorization of similar crowdsourcing schemes as “games with a purpose.” Early academic and industry lore has framed CAPTCHA as a system wherein uniquely and verifiably “human” computational capabilities are exploited and leveraged for large-scale crowdsourced human labor to train artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. This thesis investigates human-CAPTCHA encounters wherein the former is cast as a normatively defined user, precarious voluntary worker, and ambivalent player. By critical making a series of research products, it aims to articulate the politics and poetics of the CAPTCHA as an outdated insistence on ontological human-bot differences, a data labeling environment whose working conditions are inexplicably opaque, and a gamic space whose emotional and affective experience should be taken seriously in its own right. This thesis aims to deliver an anatomy of CAPTCHA across scales, from its interfacing individual and communities of user-worker-players to its positionality as a data collection technology within surveillance capitalism.

### RP2: CAPTCHA Log
A Firefox extension to a build an archive of contextual data→information about CAPTCHAs encountered during everyday browsing. The extension focuses on hCaptcha, Arkose MatchKey, and Arkose funCaptcha for their (as personally observed) multi-step, increasingly cognitively burdensome user experience. The extension conducts lightweight logging for other (major) CAPTCHA schemes.
